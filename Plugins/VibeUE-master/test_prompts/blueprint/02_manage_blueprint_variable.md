# Blueprint Variable Tests

Tests for creating and configuring variables with various types. Run sequentially.

---

## Setup

Create an actor blueprint called VariableTest in the Blueprints folder. if it already exists delete it and create a new one.

---

## Finding Types

What widget types are available? I want to store a reference to a UI element.

---

Note down the full type path for user widgets.

---

Add a variable called AttributeWidget using that widget type.

---

Verify it was created.

---

## Basic Types

Add a float variable called Health.

---

Add an integer called MaxHealth.

---

Add a boolean called IsAlive.

---

Add a string called PlayerName.

---

Show me all the variables.

---

## Complex Types

What Niagara system types exist?

---

Add a variable called DeathEffect using the Niagara type.

---

What about sound cue types?

---

Add a JumpSound variable with that type.

---

Show me the variable info for those.

---

## Variable Metadata

Create another Health variable with a Combat category and a helpful tooltip. Make it editable in the details panel.

---

Show me the info on that.

---

Actually, move it to the Stats Combat subcategory.

---

Make it read-only in blueprints so nothing can accidentally change it.

---

Verify those metadata changes.

---

## Default Values

Set Health to default to 100.

---

IsAlive should default to true.

---

Check what values got set.

---

PlayerName should default to "TestPlayer".
